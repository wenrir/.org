#+title: Readme

* Motivation
This is my first iteration in escaping the configuration abyss that I've for years been sinking into.
After multiple projects and setups, I recognized the same pattern,
1) Setup my system
2) Write and add configurations
3) Forget why (or that I added) a configuration in the first place
4) Revisting configs and get lost in the mess.
I got tired of sinking, it was time to swim.

I started this project without any intention of sharing it, it's just a collection of literate dotfiles. If used locally, beware that this is just for reference and ultimately you should not run any code from this repo without understanding it's purpose.

* Structure
Each subdirectory relates to one configuration file on the host system.
Configuration files in each subdirectory are tangled with the taget configuration file defined in the header.

*** [CONFIG-DIRECTORY]/configname.org
Main configuration, using tangle and noweb to target specific configuration files on the system.
*** [CONFIG-DIRECTORY]/config.org
Contains configuration blocks inheirited to `configname.org`.
*** [CONFIG-DIRECTORY]/secrets.org
Contains encrypted configuration blocks inheirited to `configname.org`. [not stored in git]
Template available under `util/secrets.template.org`
