A login shell is an invocation mode, in which the shell reads files intended for one-time initialization, such as system-wide /etc/profile or the user's ~/.profile or other shell-specific file(s). These files set up the initial environment, which is inherited by all other processes started from the shell (including other non-login shells or graphical programs). Hence, they are read only once at the beginning of a session, which is, for example, when the user logs in to the console or via SSH, changes the user with sudo or su using the --login parameter, or when the user manually invokes a login shell (e.g. by bash --login).
